The TSP is an NP-hard problem. To start with, we can randomly generate a tour that meets the condition of visiting all of the cities without caring about the optimal solution. Then, we can work to improve the solution with each iteration. Each tour generated in an iteration is called a candidate solution (also called a certificate). Proving that a certificate is optimal requires an exponentially increasing amount of time. Instead, different heuristics-based solutions are used that generate tours that are near to optimal but are not optimal.\n","## 1- Brute-force strategy\n","The first solution that comes to mind to solve the TSP is using brute force to come up with the shortest path in which the salesperson visits every city exactly once and returns to the initial city. So, the brute-force strategy works as follows:\n","Evaluate all possible tours.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ypGNpdQs_UUD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","from itertools import permutations\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from collections import Counter\n","from time import time"],"metadata":{"id":"5RWOAt7K_wt2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","Distance and Tour calculations"],"metadata":{"id":"k1fbAnk7_0KF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["aCity = complex\n","\n","def distance_points(first, second):\n","    return abs(first - second)\n","\n","def distance_tour(aTour):\n","    return sum(distance_points(aTour[i - 1], aTour[i])\n","               for i in range(len(aTour))\n","               )\n","\n","def generate_cities(number_of_cities):\n","    seed = 111\n","    width = 500\n","    height = 300\n","    random.seed((number_of_cities, seed))\n","    return frozenset(aCity(random.randint(1, width), random.randint(1, height))\n","                     for c in range(number_of_cities))"],"metadata":{"id":"hA2Rg3YYAFEL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Brute Force Algorithm"],"metadata":{"id":"9GwXO5EfAIJw"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-hVJHvca-jZn"},"outputs":[],"source":["def brute_force(cities):\n","    return shortest_tour(permutations(cities))\n","\n","def shortest_tour(tours):\n","    return min(tours, key=distance_tour)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Visualization"],"metadata":{"id":"ysgI1xweAy9E"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def visualize_tour(tour, style='bo-'):\n","    if len(tour) > 1000:\n","        plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))\n","    start = tour[0:1]\n","    visualize_segment(tour + start, style)\n","    visualize_segment(start, 'rD')\n","\n","def visualize_segment(segment, style='bo-'):\n","    plt.plot([X(c) for c in segment], [Y(c) for c in segment], style, clip_on=False)\n","    plt.axis('scaled')\n","    plt.axis('off')\n","\n","def X(city):\n","    return city.real\n","\n","def Y(city):\n","    return city.imag"],"metadata":{"id":"tWRI4lDnAyro"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["TSP function"],"metadata":{"id":"-YjY2ZMmAcPS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def tsp(algorithm, cities):\n","    t0 = time()\n","    tour = algorithm(cities)\n","    t1 = time()\n","    # Every city appears exactly once in tour\n","    assert Counter(tour) == Counter(cities)\n","    visualize_tour(tour)\n","    print(\"{}: {} cities => tour length {:.0f} (in {:.3f} sec)\".format(\n","        name(algorithm), len(tour), distance_tour(tour), t1-t0))\n","\n","def name(algorithm):\n","    return algorithm.__name__.replace('_tsp', '')"],"metadata":{"id":"9ys9aSpMAcz0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Lets run it"],"metadata":{"id":"GnLs84GpAlCC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tsp(brute_force, generate_cities(10))"],"metadata":{"id":"o7o7fFN-AiZJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2- Greedy Algorithm\n","If we use a greedy algorithm to solve the TSP, then, at each step, we can choose a city that seems reasonable, instead of finding a city to visit that will result in the best overall path.
